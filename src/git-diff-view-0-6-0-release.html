<p>After 2 years of no updates, version 0.6.0 is here.</p>


<h3 id="new-features">New features:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>New UI for staged files.</li>
	<li>New UI for diff view.</li>
	<li>"Discard Changes" is now shown in a small popup menu, instead of a distracting modal.</li>
	<li>Improvement to the logic responsible to restore the old window layout.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Support for Sublime Text 3 is dropped! Users who are on Sublime Text 3 will just continue to use GitDiffView 0.5.0.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-changes">Other Changes:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A complete rewrite of the plugin.</li>
	<li>Switched to Python 3.8.</li>
	<li>Added Mypy for type-checking.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the new update should brings improvements, it doesn't mean that it is perfect.</p>

<p>The new git diff view is now able to highlight/visualize char that had been added/removed, but the code that is used to for that doesn't detect the changes how I would expect. Right now <code>difflib.ndiff</code> is <a href="https://github.com/predragnikolic/sublime-git-diff-view/blob/b94640b684186a96a04377ab30f2660a30d93a17/command_update_diff_view.py#L74-L129">used</a>. PR that could improve this are welcome.</p>
